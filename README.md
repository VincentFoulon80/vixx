A Bullet-Hell game for the Commander X16

![title screen](.images/vixx_title.png)

*Your Commander X16 got a virus ! Thankfully you have an antivirus called Vix that'll get rid of the evil software.
You play as the Vix Antivirus, scanning the computer trying to locate and destroy the virus.*

# Assembling the game

Download ACME Cross Assembler : https://sourceforge.net/projects/acme-crossass/

Install it on your filesystem, and then run :

```shell
acme -f cbm -o vixx.prg main.asm
```
